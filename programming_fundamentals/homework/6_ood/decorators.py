"""This module describes homework related to decorators.

# Implement `retry` decorator.
# If some part of code in decorated function fails, try to re-run it again.
# If decorated function executes successfully, you don't need to re-run it.
#
# 1) add some global variable like `RETRIES = 4`.
#    Use this variable for your retry decorator.
#    Failed function should retries up to 4 times.
#
# Example:
RETRIES = 4


def decorator(add_parameters_if_needed):
    # Use `RETRIES` variable here somehow.
    # You should add some behaviour here for easier testing.
    pass


@decorator
def my_func(dd_parameters_if_needed):
    # You should add some behaviour here for easier testing.
    pass

# 2) Improve previous task to make it possible to pass a parameter
#    into your decorator.
#
# Example:


def decorator(dd_parameters_if_needed):
    # You should add some behaviour here for easier testing.
    pass


@decorator(retries=4)
def my_func(dd_parameters_if_needed):
    # You should add some behaviour here for easier testing.
    pass
#
#  3) Implement decorator which caches data.
#     It means that for first run of function it should print something like:
#         `Calculated value. => <calculated_value>`
#     For second, third, ... runs it should print:
#         `Using data from cache. => <value_from_cache>`
#
#  Example:
#
@cached
def my_func():
    # Doing something.
    # E.g.:
    return "Hello, world!"

my_func() # prints `Calculated value. => Hello, world!`
my_func() # prints `Using data from cache. => Hello, world!`
my_func() # prints `Using data from cache. => Hello, world!`
my_func() # prints `Using data from cache. => Hello, world!`
